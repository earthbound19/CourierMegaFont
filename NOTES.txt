These may not be production-ready fonts.

TO DO:
Needed improvements are (or may be):

  Glyph consistency, and a widened or improved glyph set.
  Font info fixup for systems compatibility/technical correctness. It sometimes seems flaky on my system--Windows' Word displayed the proper fonts for export to a .pdf preview, while LibreOffice did not--but then other times LibreOffice did--but it might just be that my own computer system is finicky.
  New hinting. The SS ultralight exported master can look really choppy. (Everything is hinted with ttfautohint).
  The (presently) reworked exclamation and asterisk light/black master glyphs for the SS family to be reintegrated into the Multiple Master.
  Re-weighting.

I'd love to take the light and black masters for both RS and SS and create FontForge Multiple Masters with them, but I haven't the time or expertise.

DEV NOTES:
The rounded slabs of the RS family of Courier Mega were created by passing lighter weights of the Square Slab variant through FontForge's, uh...one of FontForge's features :)

To obtain the same line spacing as Courier New, copy the "TrueType-specific metrics" font information page from Courier New. All the other font metrics can be customized/auto-calculated. Only for the regular weight, though. For bold, you have to calculate/customize those.
