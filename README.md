Courier Mega RS / SS (Rounded Slab and Rounded Square Slab) are libre fonts developed from scratch, pulling heavy inspiration from the IBM Courier and Nimbus (root and) branches of the Courier fonts, with the goal of having Multiple Masters from which the development community may create any weight variants they may like.

These font families were designed to solve the problem that there don't seem to be any free as in speech and beer Courier fonts *that I particularly like*. (Courier Prime comes very close, but they settled on a weight that is too heavy for my likes.)

The name "Mega" is an "adversarial" nod to "Courier Prime"--as if this font could even be the Megatron to their "Optimus Prime"! (Thier italics look great.)

Moreover, they are actually and truly no for seriously for real the very best font-weight for screenplay writing and reading, whatever else all the "pros" say, because all of their opinions are wrong, because I say so--yes, that last was a bit facetious--and if you disagree with me (and the odds are that you have ample ground to), I provide my font development sources under a copyleft license so that you can make the font wieghts that *you* want, and also be assured that no silly corporation will make any improvements to them without being compelled to offer the improvements to you, gratis.

DETAILS WITH SOME REDUNDANCY:
There's not any super-clear "smoking gun" kind of evidence (that I've found) that IBM Courier is as freely licensed as so many vendors and designers seem to have taken it to be, and I have not found any compellingly good libre-licensed fonts that replace it, with the exception of Courier Prime, but even there, the font is too heavy for my likes, and I sure wish they'd provide the development sources for it, too (I haven't asked them to; I'd rather just make my own font).

Ergo these two new Courier fonts designed "from scratch," inspired partly by Courier IBM and Gust Cursor (the former for the general form and metrics, the latter for rounded square slabs). I hope this will either further or lead to a settling of the Courier Wars once and for all, by opening a way to the acknowledgement that *there is not any best Courier font or weight*, and instead opening a way to use whichever of two styles at any weight you may have the means or persuasion to see made.
	
Wars? Yes! Seriously, it's a joke the way people--possibly including myself--nit-pick about which Courier version is best, or whether they should all be disposed of altogether). Provided are alpha source files for two new Courier-style fonts, created from scratch: "Courier Mega Square Slab" (with sharp-cornered slab serifs) and "Courier Mega Rounded Slab" (with rounded and some bendy slab-serifs).

Multiple-master sources for both new fonts are provided, for anyone to easily generate whichever custom weight of either font may be desired, to print your screenplay at whatever weight satisfies your various readers' or your own nit-pick. I personally prefer Rounded Slab at a weight between Courier New and Courier Movie Magic Screenwriter--so many professional script-reader's weight preference on Courier is much too heavy for my likes).

What? What's that you say? These fonts look like garbage? It doesn't surprise me. I'm an amateur font designer. (You may wish to read my release notes for details about and/or the status of font development).

The font name is a tongue-in-cheeck play off of Courier Prime, with the "Mega" of this font's name as an "adversarial" (e.g. Megatron) throwback to "Prime" (e.g. "Optimus Prime). But I don't really pretend to compete with their work. I would, however, like it if they release the development files for Optimus Prime, e.g. if the FontLab/FontForge/whatever application files they used to develop it--that would make it easier for anyone to change or further develop that font to their liking.
